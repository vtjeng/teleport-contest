# Source-faithful port roadmap

This file records the goal in progress, the goals selected after it, and
unresolved debt. It holds state, not rules. `AGENTS.md` remains the authority
for implementation, validation, holdout, quality, and attribution rules, and
`.agents/selection.md` states how to read the `scan-stops.mjs` census, how the
census picks a goal inside the current milestone, how a goal is sized, and how
this file is kept short.

## Current milestone: exploration

**Objective:** movement beyond the first unobstructed step, then running,
search, doors, traps, pickup, stairs, terrain effects, vision, and status
updates. This is what a hero does moving around a level before fighting or using
items, and it comes first because a hero who cannot walk cannot reach a monster,
an object, or the stairs.

No goal is in progress and none is queued. The search goal closed at
`19b8ed1`, taking the repeated-simple-commands goal with it, and the census has
not been re-run since. Run `node scripts/scan-stops.mjs` and select the next
goal from it; `.agents/selection.md` states how to read it.

Every session and step count written into a goal is a ceiling taken from the
census that selected it, and goes stale as the port advances. Traced source
findings do not go stale, which is why they are recorded here rather than
re-derived.

## Explicit future exploration work, outside the goal in progress

- Hero or monster combat, including attacks, retaliation, monster-initiated
  displacement, knockback, damage, death, corpses, weapon selection, ranged
  attacks, spells, passives, and special damage.
- Hero- or monster-triggered traps, including holding, projectiles, status,
  magic, fire, land mines, teleportation, holes, trapdoors, migration, and
  living-statue effects.
- Hero or monster relocation and every level transition, including deferred
  transitions, D:2 generation, and rolling-boulder traps. Two sessions stop on
  `wizlevelport`, which belongs here. `#levelchange` does not, despite the name:
  `wizcmds.c wiz_level_change()` prompts "To what experience level do you want
  to be set?" and drives `exper.c pluslvl()` and `losexp()` on `u.ulevel`, and
  its body contains no `goto_level`, `u.uz` or `dunlev` reference at all. The
  five sessions and 1,785 steps behind it belong to an experience-level family,
  not to this one, and treating them as relocation work would overstate this
  family and understate that one when the next goal is selected.
- Objects and inventory behavior, including automatic pickup, pet food and
  fetching, monster pickup, equipment, naming, billing, and object damage. One
  session stops on a pet picking up a food ration.
- Regions, engravings, ice, pools, lava, fountains, sinks, graves, altars, gas
  clouds, liquid effects, and every other special-terrain or room effect.
- Closed, locked, trapped, broken, or obstructing doors; tunneling; boulder
  breaking; iron bars; and other non-clear destination handling beyond a
  no-time refusal against wall or rock. `svc.context.door_opened`, which
  `test_move()` clears on entry and the closed-door branch sets, is the seam
  this attaches to. One session stops on a diagonal doorway refusal.
- `pickup.c:describe_decor()` and the `iflags.prev_decor` per-square memory it
  keys off, needed once `mention_decor` is set. It deliberately suppresses the
  open-door and doorway cases.
- The hero-destination stop for a decorated square that holds an object.
  `invent.c:dfeature_at()` and `stairs.c:stairs_description()` are ported now,
  so what remains is admitting that square in `js/hack.js` and recording the
  fresh differential for a walk onto a staircase or doorway holding one
  object.
- `hack.c:overexert_hp()`, the hit point `moveloop_core()` costs a hero who
  moved above `MOD_ENCUMBER` every thirtieth turn, and the `fall_asleep()`
  pass-out at one hit point. The elapsed turn stops there instead.
- `hack.c:test_move()`'s two zero-time diagonal doorway refusals, which set
  `svc.context.move` to FALSE, call `nomul(0)`, and print through
  `flags.mention_walls`. Both are refusals rather than moves, so the admission
  seam stops on them; porting them means owning a no-time refusal that still
  paints a frame.
- Special monster movement or actions, including hiding, shapechanging,
  covetous tactics, fleeing teleportation, conflict, watch or quest behavior,
  speech, item use, and themed-room monster behavior beyond an inert wait.
- `js/dogmove.js` `heroDeaf()` does not match youprop.h:125, which defines
  `Deaf` as `(HDeaf || EDeaf || u.uroleplay.deaf)`. It reads `u.uprops[DEAF]`
  alone and adds a `blocked` term the macro has no counterpart for, so
  `OPTIONS=deaf` will diverge in dogmove.c's leashed-pet trap arm. The delta
  review recorded at `2adc5af` confirmed the mismatch and rejected it as a
  finding, because `js/unported_monster_actions.js` refuses a leashed pet
  before `dog_move()` runs, which makes the arm unreachable today. Fix it with
  the leashed-pet work; every other `Deaf` reader in the port already ORs the
  conduct in.
- Pet states beyond an ordinary active starting pet, including eating,
  carrying, leashes, steeds, arrival or wait strategies, conflict, confusion,
  stun, fear except for the source-bounded continuation after this milestone's
  safe-pet refusal, ranged attacks, and combat.
- Every remaining command, including count prefixes, travel, force-fight,
  pickup commands, and the extended-command set. `hack.c lookaround()`'s
  corridor-widening arm hangs on this: it needs `svc.context.run == 2`, which
  only `do_rush()` behind the `g` prefix sets, and `ADMITTED_RUN_MODES` in
  `js/cmd.js` admits 0, 1 and 3 only. Until the prefix is ported the arm and its
  `flags.mention_walls` message have no recorded case, and
  `scripts/hack.test.mjs` is their whole evidence.

Several source-faithful helpers for these families are already committed. They
remain preserved prerequisites; their existence does not make their live
behavior part of a goal in progress.

## Unresolved

### Display

#### `flush_screen()` rebuilds the whole screen

`js/display.js flush_screen()` calls `_buildScreenOutput()`, which clears the
terminal and repaints from `game.level`. `display.c`'s writes only the glyph
buffer entries whose `gnew` is set and never clears, and `select_menu()` sets
`gb.bot_disabled` so `bot()` is skipped while a menu owns the screen.

That difference became reachable when `js/getline.js` ported
`pline.c vpline()`'s `if (u.ux) flush_screen(...)`, which the `#` prompt
genuinely needs. The call is faithful; the function it calls is not. At the two
pre-existing menu-search call sites the rebuild erases the open menu, and the
correctness pass over `60bf3d0..f826ba5` reproduced it end to end.

`.agents/review.md` puts this outside audit-fix scope: it changes rendering
behavior and needs a mechanism the port lacks. Do not paper over it by dropping
the `flush_screen(1)` call, which `vpline()` really does make. Port the `gnew`
dirty discipline and `gb.bot_disabled` so `flush_screen()` repaints only changed
cells, then satisfy the readiness note again and run a new full correctness pass
over the expanded range, as that file requires.

Three findings from that pass are the same defect seen from three angles: the
menu erasure itself, the two menu call sites left untested against it, and the
missing `state === game` guard that the other port of the same C line carries.
A fourth, `clearMessageWindow()` blanking map rows where C repaints them
through `docorner()`, shares the cause and belongs with them.

This is a goal of its own, not a slice of the extended-command goal. Its
upstream owners are `display.c flush_screen()` (2207-2266) with the
`gbuf_start[]`/`gbuf_stop[]` bounding box that `show_glyph()`, `cls()` and the
`reset_glyph_bbox` macro maintain; `windows.c select_menu()` (1855-1865) and
`getlin()` (1867-1901), which save, set and restore `gb.bot_disabled`; and
`botl.c bot()` and `timebot()`, whose early returns read it. None of that is in
`cmd.c`, `extcmdlist[]`, or `win/tty/getline.c`; the `#` prompt is a witness
rather than the owner, and the two victims in `js/tty_menu.js` predate it.

Size it as a goal with a checklist. `_buildScreenOutput()` in
`js/display.js:2799-2863` is the port's only map renderer, behind `docrt()` and
all eleven `flush_screen()` call sites, so converting it to per-cell
`print_glyph` puts every currently matching screen at risk. It is not urgent:
it owns no fail-closed boundary, and every one of the 398 emitted screens
matches today, so nothing is emitted-and-wrong.

#### two more gaps on the same wrapped top line

The `clearMessageWindow()` finding folded into the entry above is not alone on
the row a wrapped prompt spills onto. Two further divergences land on the same
screen, and none of the three can be validated against a C recording without
the other two, because one prompt longer than the terminal row exercises them
together.

- `topl_putsym()`'s newline arm ports the `cl_end()` at `topl.c:322` and drops
  the one at `topl.c:340`, where `if (cw->curx == 0) cl_end()` wipes the whole
  row it moved onto, so the old map row stays visible to the right of a wrapped
  prompt.
- `ttyDisplay->toplin` never takes `TOPLINE_SPECIAL_PROMPT`, which C assigns at
  `getline.c:56`. Its readers at `topl.c:139`, `155` and `163` are each gated on
  a nonzero `ttyDisplay->cury`, so the missing state first matters on that same
  wrapped line.

Both sites now say in a comment what they omit and why. Fix them with the
`flush_screen()` goal, then record a differential for a prompt longer than 78
characters. `scripts/run-extended-command-prompt.mjs` stops one character short
of that wrap deliberately: `hooked_tty_getlin()`'s `BUFSZ` and `COLNO` length
cap sits beyond it and stays unreachable until this lands.

The other eight findings the pass recorded at `e892300` deferred are closed at
the commit that added this entry: four comments now describe the code they sit
on, and four tests now fail against the mutations they were supposed to catch —
`doextcmd()`'s default arm, the generated table's unpinned rows and flag values,
`##` recursion, and the input-length segment.

The pass record in `QUALITY.json` has one imprecision worth knowing when reading
it: its `productionDefects` list names the two `flush_screen()` companions but
omits the `clearMessageWindow()` defect above, listing a test finding in its
place. The counts are right and the ledger is append-only, so the correction
lives here rather than in the record.

#### `newsym()` omits the infrared arm

`display.c newsym()` has an out-of-sight arm that shows a monster when
`see_with_infrared(mon) && mon_visible(mon)`; `js/display.js newsym()` does not.
Reproduce with seed 7000063, a female chaotic orcish Rogue, moves `" L"`: C's
mid-run animation frames show `r` at `<11,13>`, a square the hero could see but
cannot, and the port leaves it blank.

The room-run slice found this and left it, because `newsym()` is load-bearing
for every screen the port draws and the slice's own boundary did not need it.
That case is deliberately absent from `scripts/run-room-runs.mjs`. Fix it with
the infravision work rather than inside a movement slice.

#### an indented inverse menu heading cannot match

The spell menu's column header records as `\x1b[20C\x1b[7m    Name`: C moves
the cursor to the window edge, turns inverse video on, prints four spaces, then
prints `Name`. `serialize()` in `frozen/terminal.js`, which the judge
substitutes for `js/terminal.js`, finds the first cell in the row whose
character is not a space and emits the cursor-forward jump ahead of any SGR
sequence, so those four cells decode as default-attribute spaces. The scorer
does not forgive that: `SPACE_VISIBLE_ATTRS` in `frozen/screen-decode.mjs`
counts inverse and underline as visible on a space, so `diffCell()` reports
`attr` and the screen misses on four cells.

Twelve recorded screens across nine development sessions carry that heading,
every one of them a spell list under the default
`menu_headings:[no-color&inverse]`. A heading whose text starts at a glyph, such
as the options menu's `General`, is unaffected, which is why the inventory menu
matches. The `+` segments added to `scripts/run-no-time-commands.mjs` at
`ff6efb9` set `menu_headings:none` to sidestep it.

No fix in game code exists, because `AGENTS.md` requires leaving
`js/terminal.js` unchanged and the judge replaces it regardless. Treat it as a
ceiling: a session that displays the spell menu under the default option loses
that screen however faithful the port is.

### Game behavior

#### `nomul()` has two owners and they disagree

`hack.c nomul()` is ported twice. `js/hack.js:274-283` `nomul()` is the faithful
one: it sets `disp.botl`, `u.uinvulnerable`, `u.usleep` and `multi`, then calls
`endRunning()`, which carries `hack.c:4130-4157`'s `disp.time_botl` write and
the `iflags.terrain_typ`/`classify_terrain()` pair. `js/detect.js:350-370`
`defaultNomulZero()` is the older inline copy and has neither.

`dosearch0()` calls `env.nomulZero(env)` on the secret-door and secret-corridor
finds, so with `flags.time` set, a hero running past a secret door that the
automatic search converts should get a time update and does not.

The correctness pass over `e30ea05..d1a71f7` confirmed the divergence and
`0d4a4ac` is where the second owner appeared, inside that range. It is deferred
rather than fixed there because `.agents/review.md` returns a finding that
changes a state owner to Implementation: the fix consolidates two owners into
one and needs its own fresh differential, with `flags.time` on, a Ranger's
SEARCHING intrinsic, and a secret door beside the run.

#### the mfndpos rollback restores what nothing changed

`snapshotMfndposMutation()` in `js/monmove.js:900` captures each of the nine
`poss` slots and `info` values before `mfndposCore()` runs, and
`restoreMfndposMutation()` writes them back. Both loops are dead:
`resetMfndposData()` now reassigns `data.poss` and `data.info` to fresh arrays
as its first act, so the core never touches the captured objects, and restoring
the two array references alone reproduces the pre-call state. The comment above
the snapshot justifies the per-slot work with a caller state the same commit
made impossible.

`scripts/monmove.test.mjs:2021-2036` cannot tell: its three assertions are all
satisfied by the two reference restores, so deleting the per-slot branches
leaves it green. Deferred to a `/simplify-codebase` pass, which is what
`.agents/review.md` routes dead declarations to.

#### a vision recalculation stops the cloned monster scan

Converting a secret door that stands in the hero's current vision sets
`vision_full_recalc`, and the cloned planning scan then refuses `visionRecalc`
at `js/unported_monster_actions.js:618`. That refusal is deliberate and its
comment says why: `mon.c movemon_singlemon()` runs `vision_recalc(0)` for the
first ration-spending monster after `movemon()`'s tail sets the flag, which
rebuilds `vision.c`'s live global buffers, and the dry run cannot reproduce
that rebuild.

The search slice met this while choosing fresh cases: 21 of 40 candidate seeds
stopped here rather than on anything the slice owned, so
`scripts/run-explicit-search.mjs` uses secret doors outside current vision. The
debt is the vision subsystem's, and it will reappear in any slice that changes
a blocking point.

Find the writers with `grep -rn vision_full_recalc js/` rather than from a list
here, which goes stale. As at `c706db8` six places set the flag and four clear
it. The two that matter most to this entry are easy to miss: `js/vision.js:165`
`rebuildVisionPoint()`, which owns `block_point()`, `unblock_point()` and
`recalc_block_point()`, and `js/detect.js:186`, a line-for-line duplicate of it.
`js/mon.js:129` is the `movemon()` tail described above.

#### no fresh case covers the secret-corridor arm

`dosearch0()`'s SCORR arm is ported and shares its shape with the SDOOR arm,
but it has focused tests only. The search slice generated 28,000 levels without
once placing the hero adjacent to a secret corridor, so no recorded case
exercises it end to end. Record one when a level generator or a starting
position that reaches an adjacent SCORR becomes available.

#### the `m` prefix loses a frame

C emits a screen and a cursor position for the `m` prefix and the port emits
none. The search slice's worker reported reproducing this at seed 9300001 with
`wait` as well as with `search`, which places it before that slice rather than
inside it; the reproduction has not been repeated independently, so treat the
seed as a lead rather than as recorded evidence.

`js/cmd.js` has no `m` prefix handling at all, so the refusal is the port's
general unbound-or-unadmitted path. It belongs with the prefix work that
`hack.c lookaround()`'s corridor-widening arm also waits on.

#### `blocksMove()` reads the wrong door field

`js/hack.js blocksMove()` tests `loc.doormask`, but `js/mklev.js` writes an
ordinary door's mask to `loc.flags` (lines 2554-2565), and the same file's
`doorMask()` helper already reads `flags || doormask`. A generated closed or
locked door therefore answers FALSE to `blocksMove()`.

No wrong output follows today: `js/hack.js:488` reaches
`requireSimpleHeroDestination()` through its `typ === DOOR` arm and refuses the
square there instead, so the door is still refused, by a different route than
the code intends. Fix it with the closed-door work, which is where the two
routes stop agreeing, and take a fresh differential when doing so, because it
changes which refusal a closed door takes.

#### a live monster refusal escapes as a hard failure

`UnsupportedMonsterCreationError` is listed in
`ELAPSED_TURN_PLANNING_REFUSALS`, which converts it to a turn boundary, but
that conversion covers only the cloned planning round. `advanceElapsedTurn()`
supplies that round only when `projected_capacity(state) > 0`, so an
unencumbered hero never dry-runs the turn, and the same refusal thrown by the
live `maybe_generate_rnd_mon()` leaves `runSegment()` as a hard failure. A
segment then loses its matching screens instead of keeping the prefix.

The correctness pass recorded at `eb7e17e` confirmed this and verified it is
older than the range it audited: the identical probe at the parent produces
identical output. Converting on the live path alone would not be enough,
because moves and the regeneration draws are already spent by then, so the fix
is a preflight for the unburdened path, as `preflightGetHungry()` and
`preflight_nh_timeout_elapsed_turn()` already do for theirs.

### Process

#### recording a debug-mode session needs local setup

Two constraints bind anyone recording a `playmode:debug` case, both found while
closing the `#` prompt slice at `f826ba5`.

The recorder denies debug mode unless its `sysconf` names the running user:
`WIZARDS=root games vtjeng`. That file is gitignored and uncommitted, so a fresh
checkout does not have it. Without it the recorder falls back to explore mode
and diverges from the intended run at PRNG call 202, which looks like a port
defect rather than a setup problem.

And a debug segment cannot be followed by another segment in one recording.
`set_playmode()` renames the hero to "wizard", and `record-session.mjs`
`clearStaleState` strips those files only before a recording's first segment, so
a second debug game in the same recording dies. Record debug cases one segment
at a time; the four in `scripts/run-extended-command-prompt.mjs` are.

This matters beyond the current slice: five development sessions stop at
`wiz_level_change`, so every one of them will need debug-mode recordings.

#### a mistyped substitution name disables a test

A test substitutes its own function for a real one by naming it in the `env`
object a ported function reads:

    const erodeObject = env.erodeObject ?? erode_monster_object;

The lookup accepts any name. `erodeObj` falls through to the real
implementation, so a substitution written to fail the test if it ever runs
never runs, and the suite reports green. Only a substitution with nothing but
that tripwire is silent; one whose call is recorded and asserted afterwards
fails when its name goes stale.

Six places are confirmed, each by renaming a key and watching the suite stay
green on 29 July 2026:

| File | What is disarmed |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/dogmove.test.mjs` | four tripwires at lines 536, 607, 713, 739; two more at 606 and 639 resolve through `js/dogmove.js` itself |
| `scripts/dogmove-inventory.test.mjs` | the `classified` guard at line 194, and `canCarry` at 347, which passes for the wrong reason |
| `scripts/dogmove-goal.test.mjs` | `couldSee` at line 672, which reaches the asserted outcome through the default |
| `scripts/monmove-items.test.mjs` | the `monsterCanSee` tripwire at line 415 |
| `scripts/monmove-dochug.test.mjs` | five tripwires; line 162 has no positive counterpart at all |
| `scripts/trap-water-damage.test.mjs` | three tripwires at lines 39, 50, 76; no helper exists, the defaults live in `js/trap_water_damage.js:17` |

`scripts/mon.test.mjs` had the same defect and `fcdca9c` fixed it, by rejecting
any override key its helper does not define.

Two mechanisms need different fixes. Where a test helper holds the defaults,
the helper rejects unknown keys. Where production resolves the operation
itself, as `js/dogmove.js:209` and `js/trap_water_damage.js:17` do, the check
belongs in production against the names that file recognises, and it must run
before the first early return: a guard placed after one leaves every path that
returns earlier unprotected.

A worked fix for `js/trap_water_damage.js` turns all three of its silent
renames into failures. It moves the two fallbacks into one frozen table, drops
the third parameter from `waterOperation()`, and calls
`requireKnownWaterOperations(env)` as the first statement of the exported
function. 28 lines added, 12 removed.

`js/dogmove.js` is harder. It resolves operations through five idioms in one
file: an object literal at lines 207-214, bare `??` at line 333, and three
lookup helpers taking the name as a string at lines 397, 455, and 830. A check
there means routing every resolution through one helper backed by one table.
Budget an afternoon.

There are 223 `?? fallback` resolutions across 49 files in `js/`. Most are
covered by no tripwire and need nothing. These seams shrink as the port
advances, so fix the proven six and leave the rest.

## Later milestones

This list selects the next milestone; `scripts/scan-stops.mjs` selects goals
inside whichever milestone is current. After the current milestone, proceed in
this order:

1. **Combat and creatures:** complete melee, damage and death, the remaining
   monster and pet behavior, monster inventory, conditions, and common creature
   abilities.
2. **Item interaction:** inventory commands and menus, wield/wear, eat/quaff,
   read/zap, apply, throw, drop, identification, and equipment effects.
3. **Levels and persistence:** level transitions, deeper and special levels,
   save/restore, bones, and cross-segment state.
4. **Long tail:** shops, advanced spells and effects, rare monsters and items,
   endgame branches, and remaining valid commands and options.
