# Workflow friction log

Observations for later triage, not confirmed defects or approved changes.
The main orchestrator records its own friction and relevant worker reports.
Append short entries; add recurrences to an existing entry when recognized.

For each entry, record:

- Context: date, task, commit, and command or step.
- Friction: what happened and its impact—retries, blocked work, or time.
  Label estimates; leave unknowns explicit.
- Evidence: error excerpts and log, artifact, or run references. Preserve
  enough detail to understand the issue if temporary files disappear,
  including a special script's purpose and key operations.
- Reason: why the work was needed. Cite any instruction requiring it or
  earlier evidence that appeared to make a check redundant.
- Outcome: workaround, result, and remaining concern.

No solution or priority is required. Preserve entries and append later
triage decisions or fix references.
